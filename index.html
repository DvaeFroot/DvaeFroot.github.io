        <p>
          CMSC 22 was not my best subject for the A.Y. 2021-2022 1st Semester,
          but it was the subject I had the most fun with. Developing a game
          using only a graphics library was something I thought I could never do
          but I did. Implementing the systems I was familiar with from other
          game engines from scratch was satisfying and it also allowed me to
          gain a better understanding of the internals of game engines.

      <p><b>FAVORITE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:</b> C#</p>
      <p><b>WHY?</b></p>
      <div class="paragraph-wrapper">
        <p>
          While C# has a lot of uses, I am particularly interested in how often
          it is used for game development. It is the Unity Engine's primary
          programming language, Stardew Valley's programming language, as well
          as Terraria's. Learning this language also allows you to modify or mod
          games which extends the amount of content that a game can have that
          the original developer could not include in the base game.
