          CMSC 22 was not my best subject for the A.Y. 2021-2022, but it was the
          subject I had the most fun with. Developing a game using only a
          graphics library was something I thought I could never do but I did.
          Implementing the systems I was familiar with from other game engines
          from scratch was satisfying and it also allowed me to gain a better
          understanding of the internals of game engines.

      <p><b>FAVORITE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:</b> C#</p>
      <p><b>WHY?</b></p>
      <div class="paragraph-wrapper">
        <p>
          While C# has a lot of uses, I am particularly interested in how often
          it is used for game development. It is the Unity Engine's primary
          programming language, Stardew Valley's programming language, as well
          as Terraria. Learning this language also allows you to modify or mod
          games which extends the amount of content that a game can have that
          the original developer could not include in the base game.
