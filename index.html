        <p>
          CMSC 22 was not my best subject for the A.Y. 2021-2022 1st Semester,
          but it was the subject I had the most fun with. Developing a game
          using only a graphics library was something I thought I could never do
          but I did. Implementing the systems I was familiar with from other
          game engines from scratch was satisfying and it also allowed me to
          gain a better understanding of the internals of game engines.

      <p><b>FAVORITE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:</b> C#</p>
      <p><b>WHY?</b></p>
      <div class="paragraph-wrapper">
        <p>
          While C# has a lot of uses, I am particularly interested in how often
          it is used for game development and modding. It is the Unity Engine's primary
          programming language as well as some popular games' programming
          language such as Stardew Valley, Risk of Rain 2 as well as Terraria. While the base
          games can already provide so much content, the ability to add
          user-made content easily makes games almost infinitely playable. I
          think that it is also because C# is the programming language used that
          content of games like Stardew Valley and Terraria are easily
          extensible through modding.
